This repository contains the work done as part of the Batch-6 AI project on 
air pollution and air quality monitoring. The goal is to analyze pollution datasets, build visual dashboards, and
explore relationships between weather, geography, and air quality.

Project Overview:
1.Collect and clean air pollution datasets from multiple sources.
2.Combine air quality data with weather information and geospatial features.
3.Build dashboards and visualizations to identify high-risk pollution zones.
4.Experiment with basic models to understand factors affecting AQI.

Dataset Information
Contains city-level air quality measurements (PM2.5, PM10, NO2, O3, etc.).
Includes weather features (temperature, humidity, wind speed, etc.).
Includes geospatial / OSM features like roads, industries, dumpsites, and agricultural areas.
